        Please use our map to help you identify frontline sites requesting PPE that allow non-medical grade
        donations. You can use our "PPE needed" filter to select "homemade" or "makerspace" items, which will
        show
        you the locations that can receive your items.

        As much as our recipients need PPE, they must also manage the risk incurred by using
        non-medical grade items. Many institutions do not have the resources to vet all of the
        contributions they receive from various donors, and some are more comfortable only using
        the medical-grade items that they are familiar with and know they can rely on.
      </p>
      <p class="i18n" data-i18n="ftm-faq-sites-non-medical-grade-answer-2">
        To ensure that your contributions are not wasted, please filter healthcare providers by "handmade" or
        "makerspace" items to locate the ones that can use your contribution!

        building, resource sharing, and advocacy, within the maker movement and beyond. Nation
        of Makers is supporting maker organizations during the COVID-19 crisis by connecting
        them to facilities that need PPE, identifying suppliers (and discounts) for maker
        groups fabricating PPE, and identifying funding sources for groups producing PPE. They
        are also collating <a href="https://www.nationofmakers.us/covid-19-maker-response">
